                        <strong>To my Love.</strong>
                        <p>
                            I know when you asked me to write a letter this is probably not what you expected,<br>
                            I'll be honest with you I'm bad with words so I thought combining it with some coding would make it easier.<br><br>

                            I wanted to say how much everything changed the moment you stepped foot into my life.<br>
                            Everything started to feel so much lighter.<br>
                            You make my bad days into good within a minute of just talking to you.<br><br>

                            I have never in my life imagined I'd end up with such an amazing person like you.<br>
                            I love every single detail about youâ€”every cell, every piece of DNA (yes I'm using a bit of biology here). What I love the most<br>
                            is that pretty smile of yours. It makes me weak.<br>
                            I hope you know there's nothing that could ever replace you or have any importance to me more than you.<br><br>

                            I love you so deeply and I'm so grateful for you.<br>
                            I will forever be grateful for you.<br>
                            You mean more to me than I ever thought someone could. Loving you feels like a blessing<br>
                            to me, and I want to keep loving you for eternity.<br><br>

                            I want to say more, but there's not much that could fit in here.<br><br>

                            - from your bad with words girlfriend &lt;3
